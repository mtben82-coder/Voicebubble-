# VoiceBubble Overlay Guide

## 🎯 How the Android Overlay Works

The VoiceBubble floating overlay is like Grammarly - it appears as a bubble on your screen when your keyboard is open, allowing you to use voice-to-text in ANY app.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

### 1. Enable Overlay on First Launch

When you first open VoiceBubble:
1. Complete the onboarding screens (1, 2, 3)
2. On the **Permissions screen**, tap **"Grant Permissions"**
3. Android will ask for **"Display over other apps"** permission
4. **Enable it** ✅
5. The overlay will automatically start!

### 2. Using the Overlay

Once enabled, you'll see:

**On the Home Screen:**
- A green banner saying **"Overlay is active!"**
- You can **Enable/Disable** it anytime with the button

**In Other Apps:**
- Open any app (WhatsApp, Gmail, Instagram, etc.)
- When you tap a text field and **keyboard opens**
- You'll see the **VoiceBubble floating bubble** (purple/pink gradient)
- **Tap the bubble** to expand it

### 3. Recording from Overlay

When you tap the bubble:
1. **Expanded overlay popup appears**
2. **Tap & Hold** the microphone icon to record
3. Speak your message
4. **Release** to stop recording
5. Your speech appears as text
6. **Choose a style** (Magic, Email, Casual, etc.)
7. Tap **"Generate Text"**
8. AI rewrites your text
9. **Copy** and paste into your app!

## ⚙️ Overlay Settings

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Overlay Not Showing?

**Re-enable in App:**

### Overlay Disappeared?
